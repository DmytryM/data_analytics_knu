# Tasks for passing the data analytics course at KNU

## Task 1: Laboratory work #1

1. Load data, check for correctness, missing values, data types.
2. If necessary, create new variables.
3. Conduct a correlation analysis. Define the dependent and independent variables. Build visualizations.
4. Check that the assumptions of the regression analysis are met.
5. Build a model with one predictor. Evaluate the effectiveness of the model.
6. Perform residual analysis.
7. Interpret the model parameters. Construct confidence intervals for the model parameters. Test the hypotheses about the significance of the parameters.
8. Draw conclusions.

## Task 2: Laboratory work #2

Let's apply linear regression in practice - let's try to predict the cost of cars and understand what factors determine car pricing. In addition, we will learn which variables are important for forecasting and how well the obtained model describes the data.

Task:
1. Load data, check for correctness, missing values, data types.
2. Create a new feature - car brand (company). Which manufacturers' machines are found in the dataset? Next, correct the names and verify the changes.
3. Leave only a part of the predictors, after which calculate the correlation between price and other variables.
4. Convert categorical variables using pd.get_dummies() for Python and fastDummies::dummy_cols() for R.
5. Build a model with one price predictor - horsepower. What percentage of variability does the resulting model explain? (R**2)
6. Next - two models (with all predictors and with all except car brands). Note the changes in R**2, coefficients and their significance. Which model is better to leave?
7. Fill in the gaps in the following text:

The selected model explains approximately SELECT% of the variance (round to a whole). Among the predictors, CHOOSE from 27 were not significant (p > 0.05). An example of interpretation: with a unit change in the horsepower indicator, the price of CHOOSE is CHOOSE (without rounding).

## Task 2: Laboratory work #2

Description of the experiment
Before you is a table with the results of the experiment. You need to assess whether there are statistically significant differences between the control and test groups.

1000 rows Ã— 2 columns

Description of variables:

1. value - the value of the metric
2. experimentVariant - Test variant (Control - control, Treatment - test)

Task
1. Compare the result between the test and the control for the two cases:
2. Apply the bootstrap (by mean) and the Mann-Whitney U-test , then compare the p-value
3. Apply the bootstrap (by median) and the Mann-Whitney U-test and then compare the p-value.
4. Create appropriate visualizations, write conclusions that can be drawn based on the analysis of the applied criteria
